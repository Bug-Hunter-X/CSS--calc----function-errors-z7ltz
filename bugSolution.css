To fix these issues, ensure that all values within the `calc()` function have compatible units and that the operator precedence is correct using parenthesis: 

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 10px); /* Correct */
  height: calc(200px - 20px); /* Correct, using consistent px units */
  height: calc(50% - 10%); /* Correct, using percentages */ 
  width: calc((100% - 20px) / 2); /* Correct and demonstrates precedence */
}
```

Always double-check units and use parentheses to ensure calculations are performed as expected.  Simplifying calculations when possible will improve readability and reduce the potential for errors.
